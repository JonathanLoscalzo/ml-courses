    "\n",
    "When we imported our data, we let Spark guess what kind of information each column held. Unfortunately, Spark doesn't always guess right and you can see that some of the columns in our DataFrame are strings containing numbers as opposed to actual numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To remedy this, you can use the .cast() method in combination with the .withColumn() method. It's important to note that .cast() works on columns, while .withColumn() works on DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only argument you need to pass to .cast() is the kind of value you want to create, in string form. For example, to create integers, you'll pass the argument \"integer\" and for decimal numbers you'll use \"double\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can put this call to .cast() inside a call to .withColumn() to overwrite the already existing column, just like you did in the previous chapter!"

You can create what are called 'one-hot vectors' to represent the carrier and the destination of each flight.

Members of this class are Estimators that take a DataFrame with a column of strings and map each unique string to a number. Then, the Estimator returns a Transformer that takes a DataFrame, attaches the mapping to it as metadata, and returns a new DataFrame with a numeric column corresponding to the string column.\n",

    "The second step is to encode this numeric column as a one-hot vector using a OneHotEncoder. This works exactly the same way as the StringIndexer by creating an Estimator and then a Transformer. The end result is a column that encodes your categorical feature as a vector that's suitable for machine learning routines!\n",

This is repeated for each of the partitions, so that every block of data is held out and used as a test set exactly once. Then the error on each of the partitions is averaged.
